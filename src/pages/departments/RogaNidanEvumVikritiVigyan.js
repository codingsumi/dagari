                <p className="text-justify">This department deals with nosology (classification of diseases) and techniques of diagnosis. Training is given in both ancient methods of diagnosis and relevant modern investigations. Ayurveda lays great stress on detecting diseases in the very early stages of development and has developed an elaborate system of subtle diagnostic techniques to identify imbalances in the body before they transform into complicated disease processes. Ayurveda gives equal emphasis on understanding origins of disease, the disease process and the external manifestations. It understands disease as a paradoxical combination of failure of physiological mechanisms and attempts by the body to restore normalcy. Diagnosis involves a clear understanding of the therapeutic response that has been initiated by the body based on which an appropriate treatment strategy is visualised. An inherent strength of Ayurveda is its emphasis on strengthening the body from within to reverse the disease process. Roga vijnana involves developing subtle skills of pulse diagnosis and other subjective methods to feel and understand the subtle interactions between the body and mind in health and disease.</p>
