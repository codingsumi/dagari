                <p className="text-justify">Imparts training in the division of General Medicine in Ayurveda. In ancient times, the practice of Ayurveda comprised of two schools i.e medicine and surgery. Kayachikitsa, representing the school of medicine forms the basis for all other branches of Ayurvedic treatment and hence this department lays the foundation for shaping a skilled Ayurvedic physician. Panchakarma (Pentabiopurification method) as well as Rasayana (Rejuvenative medicine) and Vajikarana (Reproductive Health) come within the purview of this department. Training in this branch of Ayurvedic medicine equips the student to design a treatment protocol comprising of a range of internal and external medications as well as specialised therapies according to the nature of the disease and the patient. Ayurveda offers effective treatment for the management and control of chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, eczema, bronchial asthma, paralysis, early stages of diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, urinary tract infections and certain chronic infections.</p>
