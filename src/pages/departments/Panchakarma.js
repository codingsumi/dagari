                <p className="text-justify">Deals with the Purification therapies of Ayurveda and provides a basic understanding of the principles of Shodhana. Panchakarma includes Vamana, Virechana, Nasya, Basti karma & Raktha Mokshan, using a varied kinds of Ayurvedic medicines. As far as the treatment methods are concerned Ayurveda has described the use of Shamana (Palliative treatment) and Shodhana (Bio-Purifaction methods â€“ Panchakarma) methods. Panchakarma literally means five methods of body purification. These methods are employed in the healthy to prevent diseases and to improve the immunity as also in the sick to treat a number of diseases. Recognizing that many illnesses result from the build-up of toxins in the body that impair the functioning of its natural defenses: the lymph, circulatory and immune systems, Panchakarma promotes healing and restoration by eliminating these toxins from the body. Unlike other detoxification programs, Panchakarma is a gentle process that achieves deep cleansing without discomfort and allows rejuvenating energy to flow freely through the body.</p>
