                <p className="text-justify">This department deals with the teaching of subjects that are foundational for the study of Ayurveda like Sanskrit, basic principles, classical Ayurvedic texts, history of Ayurveda and epistemology. Proficiency in Sanskrit is indispensable to properly understand the import of classical Ayurvedic writings. This has to be further substantiated by a thorough grounding in the classical knowledge systems of India including both the theistic and atheistic schools. The evolutionary history of Ayurveda spans a few thousands of years and provides interesting insights into the development of the world of medicine itself. It is also essential for the aspirant of Ayurveda to become well versed with the approach of knowledge building delineated in the classical texts of Ayurveda, which accommodates and transcends the methods of science. The department of basic principles prepares the students with the basic intellectual tools necessary to engage in a serious study of Ayurveda. It involves complete study of various Samhitas and Sanskrit literature important for an Ayurvedic physician.</p>
