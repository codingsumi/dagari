                <p className="text-justify">The department of anatomy provides rigorous training in dissecting cadavers and critically examines both ancient and modern views on anatomy. The surgical school of Ayurveda pioneered the technique of treating dead bodies in flowing water and exposing the underlying structures by scraping the skin using soft instruments to gain accurate knowledge of minute structures that make up the human body. This practice declined over the ages due to various factors and today Ayurvedic Anatomy needs to be supplemented with modern knowledge. A unique aspect of Rachana Shareera in Ayurveda is the knowledge of the vital points or marmas, which have to be protected when performing surgical procedures and injury to which can lead to disastrous consequences including death. Knowledge of these vital points and techniques to manipulate them is essential to become proficient in therapeutic massage that stimulates prana and revitalises the body.</p>
